        <div id = "box2"> <div id = "box1"> <p style = "text-align: center;"> In today’s world energy is scarce and expensive, but a scientist by the name of Nikola tesla says otherwise. Wireless energy is possible through his famous invention ‘The Tesla Coil’. Nikola Tesla's “Tesla Coil” shows that energy could be sent without wires. It uses coils and a spark to create high-frequency electricity. Although the Tesla Coil was never finished and Tesla’s ideas wasn’t fully used, it still inspires people to create new technology. Today, we are one step closer to achieving this such as the use wireless charging for things like phones and medical devices, but there are still problems with how efficient it is.</p> </div> </div>

   <h4> <b> <ins> Insights About Nikola Tesla </ins> </b> </h4> 
   <body> Imagine a world where energy flows freely and endlessly. A dream envisioned by Nikola Tesla, whose groundbreaking inventions, including the Tesla coil, still hold the key to unlocking limitless power (2024). Nikola Tesla was born in July 10, 1856 (2024). His mother, Djuka Mandic, ignited his interests by inventing small household appliances during her free time while he was growing up (2024). Tesla dreamed of creating a way to supply power to the world without wires like we do today (Dickerson, 2014).  </body>


    <h4> <b> <ins> Why do we need a new type of energy? </ins> </b> </h4> 
          <body>In Roser’s article (2020), He claims that the world lacks a safe and cheap way to implement large energy scale alternatives to the ones we have today such as fossil fuels. If we don’t find a way to find these alternatives, we will face 2 major consequences (Roser,2020). Insufficient energy for millions of people and consequences to the environment (Roser,2020). Conflicts and wars are inevitable when resources and energy are scarce. (Mansson,2014). A way to combat our energy crises is to aim for renewable energy such as wireless energy, which is electric power that we can receive easily like receiving a signal in our phone (Stephanie, 2024).</body>
        


   <h4> <b> <ins> The Tesla Coil </ins> </b> </h4> 
   <body> An article by Dickerson (Dickerson, 2014) displays that the resulting high-frequency voltage can provide energy to light bulbs several feet away with no electrical wire connection. The entire system is powered by an external source linked to a transformer (Dickerson, 2014). In essence, the Tesla coil operates as two open electric circuits that connect through the spark gap (Dickerson, 2014). The Tesla coil is the nearest device we have to wireless electricity (Dickerson, 2014). The power source is connected to the primary coil, where the capacitor, functioning like a sponge, absorbs the charge (Dickerson, 2014). Since the primary coil must withstand significant charge and surges of current, it is typically constructed from copper due to its great conductivity (Dickerson, 2014). As the capacitor gathers charge, the current discharges from the capacitor into the primary coil, resulting in the creation of a magnetic field (Dickerson, 2014). This surge of energy leads to a rapid collapse of the magnetic field, which in turn induces an electric current in the secondary coil (Dickerson, 2014). The high voltage traveling between the two coils generates sparks within the air gap, while energy moves back and forth between the coils several hundred times per second, building up in the secondary coil and its capacitor (Dickerson, 2014). Eventually, the charge in the secondary capacitor reaches such an intensity that it is released in a burst of electric current and in other words “Wireless energy” (Dickerson, 2014).  The figure below illustrates components of the tesla coil. </body>

   <h4> <b> <ins> Flaws in the Tesla Coil </ins> </b> </h4> 
          <body> Although Nikola Tesla invented the Tesla coil, we have yet to adapt wireless energy with the technology we have today due to several factors. According to (Sirkin, 2013) Nikola Tesla's Wardenclyffe Tower aimed to provide wireless power but was never fully operational and was dismantled in 1917. Various conspiracy theories suggest that corporate or governmental forces thwarted his efforts (Sirkin, 2013). However, the complexities of wireless power are often overlooked. A example of this is the Hindenburg incident, which is caused by a static electricity discharge after the airship encountered an electrical storm (Sirkin, 2013). This connection highlights that Tesla's wireless energy and the era of airships were incompatible as his method could have created terrible conditions for air travel.(Sirkin, 2013). Tesla's wireless power never gained popularity due to its inefficiency; energy dissipates in the air and is wasted when broadcast in all directions (Sirkin, 2013). Additionally, the potential health risks of living in a constantly charged environment raise concerns about its safety(Sirkin, 2013).</body>
    
    <h4> <b> <ins> What Advancements have we made towards implementing infinite energy? </ins> </b> </h4> 
          <body>While we may not have achieved Nikola Tesla's vision of infinite energy and fully realized wireless electricity, we have made significant improvement with wireless power transmission (Xie et al., 2023). Our Modern technology, demonstrates how we can enhance energy efficiently in our daily lives. According to (Xie et al., 2023) these are some advancements made with wireless energy in the following table below:</body>
