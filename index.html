    <h4><b> <ins> ABSTRACT: </ins></b></h4>

    <body>
        <div id = "box2"> <div id = "box1"> <p style = "text-align: center;">Nikola Tesla's Tesla Coil showed that energy could be sent without wires. It used coils and a spark to create high-frequency electricity. But it didn't work well because it lost a lot of energy, and Tesla's Wardenclyffe Tower, which was meant to send power wirelessly, was never finished. Today, we use wireless charging for things like phones and medical devices, but there are still problems with how efficient and safe it is. Even though Tesla's idea wasn't fully used, it still inspires new technology today.</p> </div> </div>

   <h4> <b> <ins> Insights About Nikola Tesla: </ins> </b> </h4> 
   <body> Imagine a world where energy flows freely and endlessly. A dream envisioned by Nikola Tesla, whose groundbreaking inventions, including the Tesla coil, still hold the key to unlocking limitless power (2024). Nikola Tesla was born in July 10, 1856 (2024). His mother, Djuka Mandic, ignited his interests by inventing small household appliances during her free time while he was growing up (2024). Tesla dreamed of creating a way to supply power to the world without wires like we do today (Dickerson, 2014). </body>

   <h4> <b> <ins> The Tesla Coil: </ins> </b> </h4> 
   <body> An article by Dickerson (Dickerson, 2014) displays that the resulting high-frequency voltage can provide energy to light bulbs several feet away with no electrical wire connection. The entire system is powered by an external source linked to a transformer (Dickerson, 2014). In essence, the Tesla coil operates as two open electric circuits that connect through the spark gap (Dickerson, 2014). The Tesla coil is the nearest device we have to wireless electricity (Dickerson, 2014). The power source is connected to the primary coil, where the capacitor, functioning like a sponge, absorbs the charge (Dickerson, 2014). Since the primary coil must withstand significant charge and surges of current, it is typically constructed from copper due to its great conductivity (Dickerson, 2014). As the capacitor gathers charge, the current discharges from the capacitor into the primary coil, resulting in the creation of a magnetic field (Dickerson, 2014). This surge of energy leads to a rapid collapse of the magnetic field, which in turn induces an electric current in the secondary coil (Dickerson, 2014). The high voltage traveling between the two coils generates sparks within the air gap, while energy moves back and forth between the coils several hundred times per second, building up in the secondary coil and its capacitor (Dickerson, 2014). Eventually, the charge in the secondary capacitor reaches such an intensity that it is released in a burst of electric current and in other words "Wireless energy" (Dickerson, 2014).  </body>
